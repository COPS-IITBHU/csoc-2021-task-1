# CSOC Week1 Android

##  Introduction
The aptest definition for android is - "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets."
In short, we can say that it is an Operating system for touchscreen devices, and any device that runs on this Operating System is known as an Android Device. Now for every operating system, some applications can run on it to perform specific tasks. Similarly, for Android Devices, we have Android Apps that can run on them to perform specific tasks.

Evident enough that the software engineering field for developing such apps is known as Android App Development.
The official language for Android development is Kotlin, but Java is still used in many famous courses and many projects, so you are free to use any of them.

## Installation

### Android Studio

Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. This software is a bit heavy on normal systems (8 GB Ram & 1 TB HDD) and can be quite laggy for any systems below this configuration.

While developing an android app you will need to test it on a device. You can test it in two ways -

- [Real Device (Preferred for slower systems)](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
For testing you apps on a real device you will need to have a USB cable and an Android device. Follow this tutorial to enable USB debugging in order to run your app in the device.

- [Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)
An Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer so that you can test your application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device. It provides almost all of the capabilities of a real Android device.


## How to get started

If you haven't had any chance to develop android apps earlier then don't worry it's not too late to start now. Here are few resources to start with android development.
