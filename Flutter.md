# CSoC Week-1 Flutter

# Introduction

Flutter - promises cross platform, natively compiled apps, with slick smooth UIs. Developed by Google, the framework is gaining in popularity, especially amongst new startups.

## Single Codebase…like Java?

Flutter’s major selling point is that it allows developers to create mobile apps for Android and iOS using a single codebase. It’s possible to build a Flutter app targeting Android and build the same project on a Mac for iOS devices without changing a single line of code.

Unlike most other mobile app frameworks Flutter does not use WebView nor OEM widgets. Instead, Flutter uses its own rendering engine to draw widgets.

Apps are natively compiled too, so you’ll need a machine with Android SDK installed for targetting Android and you’ll need to be running XCode to build for iOS devices.

# Getting Started

## Installation

Here is how you can install Flutter. Do not install Android Studio right now, this week you do not require it. Read until writing your first flutter app.

[Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

To use flutter consistently between different terminal sessions, go through this

[Linux install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux#update-your-path)

Install a suitable IDE. VS Code (compared to Android Studio) is good choice for a light and better experience.
